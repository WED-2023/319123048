  <h2> Who was Frida Kahlo </h2>
  <p>Frida Kahlo was a pioneering Mexican artist renowned for her vivid and deeply personal works, often focusing on themes of identity, pain, and culture. Widely recognized for her surreal self-portraits, 
    Kahlo’s art was a reflection of both her physical struggles and her strong political views.
    Her life was marked by significant hardships, including a severe bus accident in her youth, 
    but she emerged as one of Mexico's most beloved artists and a symbol of female creativity and strength.
  </p>
  <h1> Early Life </h1>
  <p>
    Frida Kahlo was born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Mexico, under the full name Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón.
    She grew up in a house called "La Casa Azul" (The Blue House), which later became her museum. Her childhood was difficult, 
    and at the age of six, she contracted polio, which caused her to be bedridden for nine months. After recovering, 
    she had a limp because the disease affected her right leg and foot. Her father, Wilhelm (William), a German photographer,
    encouraged her to develop physical skills and participate in sports, including soccer and swimming, to aid her recovery.
  </p>
  <h1> Education </h1>
  <p>
    Frida attended the prestigious National Preparatory School in Mexico City, where she was one of the few female students. 
    She was known for her joyful personality and her love of colorful and traditional clothing and jewelry. 
    During her studies, she connected with a group of students who shared similar political views and became politically active. 
    She joined the Young Communist League and the Mexican Communist Party.
  </p>
  <h1> Family and Personal Life </h1>
  <p>
    Frida was very close to her family, especially to her father, Wilhelm, who was a German photographer. Her mother, Matilde, 
    had a significant influence on her. Frida had two older sisters, Matilde and Adriana, and a younger sister, Cristina. 
    In 1929, Frida married the renowned Mexican artist Diego Rivera. The two met in 1922 when Rivera came to her school to work 
    on a project. Over the years, Frida and Diego went through periods of separation and reconciliation, during which Frida also
     experienced personal disappointments, including a failed extramarital pregnancy.
  </p>
  <h1> The Accident and the Impact on her Art </h1>
  <p> On September 17, 1925, at the age of 18, Kahlo was severely injured in a bus accident in Mexico City.
  She was impaled by a steel handrail and sustained multiple fractures to her spine and pelvis. 
  Following several months in the hospital, she began painting as a way to cope with her pain. 
  Her first self-portrait was painted shortly after, marking the beginning of her prolific career in painting.
  </p>
  <h1> Career </h1>
  <p> Frida Kahlo is considered one of Mexico's greatest artists. Although she did not consider herself a surrealist, 
  she developed connections with André Breton, one of the central figures in the surrealist movement. 
  She exhibited her paintings in New York and Paris, where she gained worldwide recognition. One of her famous paintings,
  "Henry Ford Hospital" (1932), combines surreal and graphic elements to depict her second miscarriage. 
  Over the years, her art became increasingly popular, and she exhibited in museums around the world.
  </p>
  <h1>Activities in the Community</h1>
  <p> 
    Frida was deeply involved in politics and various social causes. She was an ardent supporter of communism and used her 
    popularity to raise awareness about social issues in Mexico. In 1937, she and Diego hosted the communist Vladimir Lenin,
    who sought asylum in Mexico, at their home. Frida also participated in political protests and was active in supporting 
    workers' movements, women's rights, and indigenous rights. Additionally, she worked on artistic projects dedicated to 
    important Mexican women, though she did not complete this work.
