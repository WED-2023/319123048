  <h2>Who Was Frida Kahlo?</h2>
<p>Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist known for her surreal self-portraits and exploration of identity, pain, and culture. Despite enduring lifelong physical struggles, she became a symbol of female creativity and strength.</p>

<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoac√°n, Mexico, Frida grew up in "La Casa Azul." At six, she contracted polio, which left her with a limp. Encouraged by her father, Wilhelm, a German photographer, she engaged in sports to aid her recovery.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Frida attended the National Preparatory School in Mexico City, where she was one of the few female students. She became politically active, joining the Young Communist League and the Mexican Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Family and Personal Life</h3>
<p>Frida was close to her father and had a strong bond with her family. In 1929, she married the renowned Mexican painter Diego Rivera. Their relationship was marked by separations and reconciliations.</p>

<h3>The Accident & Artistic Beginnings</h3>
<p>At 18, a severe bus accident left Frida with lifelong injuries. Bedridden for months, she turned to painting as an emotional and physical outlet, beginning her artistic career.</p>

<h3>Career</h3>
<p>Frida gained international recognition, exhibiting in New York and Paris. Though she didn‚Äôt consider herself a surrealist, her works, like "Henry Ford Hospital" (1932), explored deep personal and political themes.</p>

<h3>Community Involvement</h3>
<p>A passionate political activist, Frida supported communism, workers' rights, and indigenous culture. She and Diego hosted political exiles and participated in protests advocating for social change.</p>
