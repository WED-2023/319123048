<h2> About Frida Kahlo </h2>
<p> 
  <h2> Who Was Frida? </h2>
  Artist Frida Kahlo was considered one of Mexico's greatest artists who began painting mostly self-portraits 
  after she was severely injured in a bus accident. Kahlo later became politically active and married fellow communist artist 
  Diego Rivera in 1929. She exhibited her paintings in Paris and Mexico before her death in 1954
</p>
<br/>
<p>
<h2> Family, Education and Early Life </h2>
Kahlo was born Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Mexico.
Kahlo's father, Wilhelm (also called Guillermo), was a German photographer who had immigrated to Mexico 
where he met and married her mother Matilde. She had two older sisters, Matilde and Adriana, and her younger sister, Cristina,
was born the year after Kahlo. Around the age of six, Kahlo contracted polio, which caused her to be bedridden for nine months. 
While she recovered from the illness, she limped when she walked because the disease had damaged her right leg and foot. 
Her father encouraged her to play soccer, go swimming, and even wrestle — highly unusual moves for a girl at the time — 
to help aid in her recovery. In 1922, Kahlo enrolled at the renowned National Preparatory School. 
She was one of the few female students to attend the school, and she became known for her jovial spirit and her love of colorful, 
traditional clothes and jewelry. While at school, Kahlo hung out with a group of politically and intellectually like-minded students.
Becoming more politically active, Kahlo joined the Young Communist League and the Mexican Communist Party.

<p> <h2> Frida Kahlo's Accident </h2>
On September 17, 1925, Kahlo and Alejandro Gómez Arias, a school friend with whom she was romantically involved,
were traveling together on a bus when the vehicle collided with a streetcar. As a result of the collision, 
Kahlo was impaled by a steel handrail, which went into her hip and came out the other side. She suffered several 
serious injuries as a result, including fractures in her spine and pelvis.
After staying at the Red Cross Hospital in Mexico City for several weeks, Kahlo returned home to recuperate further. 
She began painting during her recovery and finished her first self-portrait the following year, which she gave to Gómez Arias.

<h2> Frida Kahlo's Marriage to Diego Rivera </h2>
In 1929, Kahlo and famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera married. Kahlo and Rivera first met in 1922 when he went to work on a project 
at her high school. Kahlo often watched as Rivera created a mural called The Creation in the school’s lecture hall. 
According to some reports, she told a friend that she would someday have Rivera’s baby.
Kahlo reconnected with Rivera in 1928. He encouraged her artwork, and the two began a relationship. 
During their early years together, Kahlo often followed Rivera based on where the commissions that Rivera received were. 
In 1930, they lived in San Francisco, California. They then went to New York City for Rivera’s show at the Museum of Modern Art 
and later moved to Detroit for Rivera’s commission with the Detroit Institute of Arts.
Kahlo and Rivera’s time in New York City in 1933 was surrounded by controversy. Commissioned by Nelson Rockefeller, 
Rivera created a mural entitled Man at the Crossroads in the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center. Rockefeller halted the work on
the project after Rivera included a portrait of communist leader Vladimir Lenin in the mural, which was later painted over.
Months after this incident, the couple returned to Mexico and went to live in San Angel, Mexico.
